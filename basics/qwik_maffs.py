#Trying to work out how to interact with variables from a python file in the terminal after the program has been run.
#Basically just giving myself some variables and values to play with!

a=4+2
b=3*5
c=10-2

print(a, b, c)

#Didn't fix the terminal thing, but I vaguely remember being told about the debugging feature of VSCode which I think does what I wanted
# Now I'm playing around with branches... so lets see how this goes!
